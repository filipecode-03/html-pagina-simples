# Simple Page
 
### About Page
This website is a simple web page, developed using only **HTML** and **CSS** technologies. It was created as one of my first activities in learning **web development**, with the aim of exploring the fundamentals of content structuring (HTML) and visual design (CSS). Although it is an initial project, it reflects the effort to understand the basic concepts that are the basis for creating modern web pages.
